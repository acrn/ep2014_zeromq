# echo

_echo_ is a system for sending messages between a _client_ and a _server_.

The protocol is being organically designed at this very moment.

## Protocol specification

echo shall be implemented using ZeroMQ sockets. The server opens a
`ROUTER` socket on port 5555, which accepts connections from an
arbitrary number of clients. The clients each connect using a `DEALER`
socket.

Upon successful connection from a client, the server expects to
receive a string of characters which it will then echo back.
